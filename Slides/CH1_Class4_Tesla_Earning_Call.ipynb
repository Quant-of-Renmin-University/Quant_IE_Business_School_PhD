In other parts of the world, we saw increase in demand, leading to record deliveries in smaller countries like Malaysia, Norway, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan, while continued strength in the rest of APAC and EMEA. We therefore ended 2025 with a bigger backlog than in recent years. Note that none of these countries have the latest version of FSD Supervised available yet.

And over the last decade, we have continually brought down the cost of our vehicles without sacrificing range, performance, or premiumness, and we'll continue to do that, as Vaibhav said, investing in our factories, but these are all trade-offs of where we spend our time or money. And to Elon's point, just now, with Cybercab coming, we are aiming to bring that Tesla premium ride experience to our largest market yet. That could be 5 or 10 times our current levels of production.

And, and, and so, so Cybercab is, like, like I said, super optimized for, minimum cost per mile and, and also for a much higher duty cycle.

One is, like, learn as much as possible from the fleet with the safety monitors, and secondly, be laser focused with the engineering team to solve the unsupervised FSD problem. I think we did both. Like, by the end of last year, we, you know, we had a long tail of issues that we were able to churn through, and then, in the last couple of weeks, we had started our unsupervised robotaxi service to public customers in Austin.

A variant of the software that's used for the robotaxi service was shipped to customers with V14, and customers saw a huge jump in performance, like a lot of, you know, happy feedback from customers. So, and since then, we have improved the software significantly as well.

My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3 P.M. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question and answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the Raise Hand button to join the question queue.",

Therefore, net additions to this figure will primarily be via subscription model and in the short term, will impact automotive margins. On the energy front, we achieved yet another record in terms of gross profit for the quarter and ended the year with nearly $12.8 billion in revenue at 26.6% year-over-year growth. This was the result of high deployments in all regions and continued strength and demand for both Megapack and Powerwall. As we look at 2026, our backlog remains strong, well-diversified globally, and we expect increasing deployments with the launch of Megapack 3 and Megablock. However, we expect margin compression from the increased low-cost competition, impacts to market from policy uncertainty, and the cost of tariffs.",

         "Yeah. We have scaled the robotaxi service that's available to customers over the last year in order to just learn the scaling problems without having to like wait for the unsupervised. Basically, I had two, two goals. One is, like, learn as much as possible from the fleet with the safety monitors, and secondly, be laser focused with the engineering team to solve the unsupervised FSD problem. I think we did both. Like, by the end of last year, we, you know, we had a long tail of issues that we were able to churn through, and then, in the last couple of weeks, we had started our unsupervised robotaxi service to public customers in Austin. I think some customers took rides last week, and also the service continues today without any rear car or something like that.",

So both are happening in parallel. A variant of the software that's used for the robotaxi service was shipped to customers with V14, and customers saw a huge jump in performance, like a lot of, you know, happy feedback from customers. So, and since then, we have improved the software significantly as well.
